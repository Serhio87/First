    <h2>A few details about myself</h2>
    
    Hello. My name is Sergey. I live and work in the city of Zhlobin, a city of metallurgists. Therefore, my entire education is related to metallurgy.
    I have been working at the Belarusian Metallurgical Plant from 2007 to the present.
    However, for the purpose of self-development, I decided to try myself in the IT field. I hope everything works out for me.
